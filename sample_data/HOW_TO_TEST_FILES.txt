Transaction Status Agent – Sample File Usage Guide
=================================================

This folder contains small demo datasets to test the Transaction Status Agent.

Supported Formats
-----------------
1. CSV
2. JSON (array format)
3. NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON)
4. Parquet (optional, generated via scripts)

Files Included
--------------
- sample_transactions.csv
- sample_transactions.json
- sample_transactions.ndjson

How to Test (Recommended)
------------------------
1. Start the API:
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload

2. Open Swagger UI:
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

3. Use the endpoint:
   POST /ingest/upload

4. Upload any one of the sample files above.

5. After ingest, test:
   - GET /transaction/{transaction_id}
   - POST /transactions/status (batch lookup)

Example transaction IDs to test:
- tx_1001, tx_1002, tx_1003
- tx_2001, tx_2002
- tx_3001, tx_3004

Expected Behavior
-----------------
- The agent normalizes raw status values (success, failed, pending, processing).
- Long-running non-final transactions may be marked as STUCK.
- Missing IDs are reported explicitly in batch responses.
- Each response includes:
  - status
  - confidence
  - reason
  - evidence
  - rules_fired

Notes
-----
- These files are intentionally small for demo purposes.
- Large-scale testing is done using the synthetic data generator.
- Schema flexibility is handled via configs/mappings.yaml.
